### About me

I’m a Computer Engineering graduate student with a strong interest in **applied machine learning, healthcare AI, and data-driven systems for real-world impact**. My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning, clinical data, and accessibility**, with a focus on building models that work under real constraints such as limited data, infrastructure, and resources.

I enjoy taking ideas from **research → prototype → deployment**, and I’m particularly motivated by problems in **medical AI, human-centered systems, and low-resource settings**.

### Research & Technical Interests

- Machine Learning for Healthcare (early disease detection, clinical decision support)
- Multimodal learning (medical imaging + clinical / metabolic data)
- Time-series modeling (irregular clinical data, early warning systems)
- Data representation & interpretability
- Accessible and human-centered AI systems

### Selected Projects & Work

- **OSTEODEEP** – Deep learning models for osteoporosis detection from X-ray images  
  *(Undergraduate thesis, TÜBİTAK-funded, IEEE publication)*

- **Early Pediatric Sepsis Prediction** –  
  Time-series modeling of clinical data (PHEMS), including LSTMs, attention mechanisms, and image-based representations (Gramian Angular Fields) for early risk detection.

- **SquintZoom** – Accessibility-focused Chrome extension that detects eye strain (squinting) and dynamically adjusts zoom level.

- **UniTex** – LaTeX-to-Unicode conversion tool, currently seeing organic adoption across multiple countries.
